  A school is always a ‘world in miniature’ where one receives a
  ‘training for life’, where effective, meaningful and joyful learning
  takes place. It is here that we begin to learn our lessons of life –
  to accept challenges, face competition, defeat and failure, and
  rejoice at victory and triumph. Beersheba Sr. Sec. School is a
  symbol of progressive and quality education. Our motto, “Learn,
  Achieve and Inspire” captures the essence of our spirit. In our
  school, children gain an all-round education and achieve their
  potential not just in the academic field but also in the field of
  sports and creative arts. The children of the school evolve as
  well-rounded individuals who have honed their skills in the
  microcosm of the school and are equipped to lead and inspire in the

  As John Dewey rightly said, “Education is not preparation for life ;
  education is life itself”.It’s impossible to move through the world
  without learning and gaining wisdom along the way. As we stand on
  the threshold of our Beersheba Senior Secondary School anniversary,
  we have realised that education is not merely putting something in
  the minds of the students,but it is showing them their own abilities
  and helping them to think and express themselves. we know that
  Beersheba Senior Secondary School was a charismatic leader who
  infused in the mind of a young child, great passion, big dream and
  passionate love for learning where a child uses his mind creatively
  and put it into practice in life.
</p>
<p className="mt-2 lg:px-10 text-lg">
  We know how a child enters into a classroom not only with
  theoretical learning but also a number of co-curricular activities.
  He uses his maximum potential, talents, participate with full vigour
  and shines like a star in the school. We are invited to aim at
  holistic growth of a child. And Beersheba provides a platform to
  achieve our purpose.
</p>
<p className="mt-2 lg:px-10 text-lg">
  So I invite you to be our collaborators Beersheba Senior Secondary
  School to touch upon the lives of students entrusted to our care.
  May the legacy of Beersheba Senior Secondary School inspire and
  propel us towards the Jesuit vision of education. May God bless you
